# Installing and Starting the App

1) Clone the repo down to your local machine
2) CD into the main directory of the project
3) Run 'npm install' to install the dependencies
4) Run 'npm start'. This should automatically open a local browser window and redirect it to the app. If not, go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the app.
5) Enjoy :D!
